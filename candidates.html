			  Hello! My name is Frenz Allen J E Paller, and I am an 18-year-old senior high school student from the Philippines. I currently study at St. Uriel Academy in Taguig City, where I am pursuing my passion for coding, gaming, and video editing.
			  Ever since I was young, I've always been fascinated by the world of technology. I also enjoy playing video games and editing videos. Gaming has been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember, and I love exploring new worlds and experiencing different types of gameplay. I also enjoy editing videos, which I find to be a creative outlet that allows me to express myself and tell stories in new and exciting ways.
			  Overall, I'm someone who is passionate about technology and is always looking to learn and grow. I believe that the future is full of possibilities, and I'm excited to be a part of it. Thank you for taking the time to read my "About Me" section, and I hope to connect with you soon!
